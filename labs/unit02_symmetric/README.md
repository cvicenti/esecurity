# Unit 2: Symmetric Key

The key concepts involved are defining key entropy; key generators (such as using hashing methods to generate keys based on passphrases); symmetric key methods (AES, Twofish, 3DES, RC4 and ChaCha20); stream or block encryption; symmetric key modes (ECB/CBC/OFB); and salting/IV.

## What you should know at the end of unit?

* The differences between a stream cipher and a block cipher.
* How salting is used to change the cipher blocks.
* Use openssl to perform practical operations.
* Understand the encoding formats used for cipher text and keys.
* Understand how key entropy can be applied to defining the strength of the encryption key.
* Define the importance difference between cipher block modes, such as between ECB and CBC.
