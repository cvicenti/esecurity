# Unit 3: Hashing and MAC

The key concepts involved are defining key entropy; key generators (such as using hashing methods to generate keys based on passphrases); symmetric key methods (AES, Twofish, 3DES, RC4 and ChaCha20); stream or block encryption; symmetric key modes (ECB/CBC/OFB); and salting/IV.

## What you should know at the end of unit?

* How the lengths of the hashes vary with the number of bits in the hash.
* How we can calculate the strengths on passwords.
* Understand how salt is applied to the hashing process.
* Define how collisions can occur within hashing.
* Implement hash cracking methods (John the Ripper and Hashcat).
* Defines the usage of signed hashes (eg HMAC).
* Outlines the usage of OTP and Timed Passwords.
